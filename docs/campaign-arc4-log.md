# Campaign Arc 4 log — the interpreter⇄invariant seam

Branch `campaign-arc4`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/campaign-arc4`,
opened from the campaign branch @ 03a91c2d (Arc-3 units 1–3
integrated). Governing: `docs/2026-08-21_raft-proof-constitution.md`
(§3 inviolables, §4.1 surgery threshold, §5 latitude);
design of record: `docs/2026-08-22_campaign-arc4-seam-design.md`
(three layers; OQ-A..OQ-D are this unit's to answer from contact).
One writer: this lane's worker. Unit in flight: **A4-U1, the pilot**
— `absState` v1 + the smallest handler interpreter-run equation +
the GO/NO-GO verdict (`docs/2026-08-22_campaign-arc4-pilot-verdict.md`).

Conventions: `[AGENT]` = judgment call under §5 latitude, logged not
pre-approved; checkpoints every ≤5 slices, numbers recomputed; kit
gaps that are GENERAL (≥2 plausible future consumers) go on the
PROMOTION LEDGER section below, target-specific ones stay local.

## Entries

- 2026-08-22 Lane verified: tip 03a91c2d, clean tree, branch
  `campaign-arc4`. Required reading done in order (constitution §3,
  seam design, Arc-1 statement design + TwinProgram/RaftAgreement,
  Arc-3 invariant index + RefinedProofStructure handlers, kit guide).
  Fresh worktree had no build; capped core `lake build`
  (GOLEAN_MEM_MAX=24G) started before instrumentation.
- 2026-08-22 [AGENT] Handler choice contact datum: the charter's
  candidate `advanceCurrentTerm` DOES NOT EXIST in the lowered
  subject — it is Verdi-side vocabulary (VerdiCompat/Raft.lean:135);
  the wire (`baselines/golden/twin-chdriver.wire.json`) has
  `raft.raft.becomeFollower` and no advanceCurrentTerm (grep over the
  9.3 MB wire: the only matches are becomeFollower). **The pilot
  handler is `becomeFollower`.**
- 2026-08-22 Static contact (wire walk, python, pre-Lean): the
  DYNAMIC call closure of the lowered `raft.raft.becomeFollower` is
  10 functions: itself → {raft.raft.reset, raft.Logger.Infof
  (interface dispatch → the harness logger's EMPTY body),
  raft.traceBecomeFollower (empty)}; reset → {raft.newReadOnly,
  raft.raft.abortLeaderTransfer,
  raft.raft.resetRandomizedElectionTimeout → raft.lockedRand.Intn,
  tracker.ProgressTracker.ResetVotes, tracker.ProgressTracker.Visit}
  + the lifted closure `raft.raft.reset$lit0` (via Visit's
  call-value) → {tracker.NewInflights, raft.raftLog.lastIndex}.
  Choice-consuming constructs INSIDE the handler: `lockedRand.Intn`
  (D-11 delta: builds an n-entry map, one `range` pick, break — ONE
  mapIter choice at n = electionTimeout = 10) and `Visit`'s `range`
  over `trk.Progress` (3 entries at n=3 — mapIter choices), then
  `sort-slice` canonicalizes order. So OQ-C's expected answer
  ("none") is ALREADY REFUTED at the smallest handler: handler
  equations must quantify over a consumed choice prefix; the
  post-state is choice-independent (sort + first-key-only uses).
  `stepFollower`/`tickElection` appear as `func-value` stores
  (assigned, not called). Mutex Lock/Unlock lower as `sync-op`.
- 2026-08-22 Dynamic contact (probe `artifacts/probe/Arc4Probe.lean`,
  compiled interpreter over the pinned wire, ch = zeros; output
  `artifacts/probe/probe2.out`): first `becomeFollower` entry (from
  `newRaft`, node 1) at subject step 21,757; the call runs
  **3,233 machine steps**, consumes **4 choices** (1 Intn pick +
  3 Visit range picks over trk.Progress), allocates **164 fresh
  cells** (locals/temporaries/param cells — nextAddr 1442→1606), and
  its persistent footprint beyond the fresh region is 5 cells:
  raft cell (base 389: .trk.Votes fresh handle, .readOnly fresh ptr,
  .randomizedElectionTimeout, .tick/.step funcVals; Term/Vote/lead/
  state unchanged at this t=Term call), MemoryStorage cell
  (.callStats — the subject's instrumented call counters increment on
  lastIndex, a REAL persistent side effect of a "read"), and the
  three tracker.Progress cells (Next/Match/RecentActive/Inflights).
  Mutex lock/unlock pairs leave NO net syncData change. Heap shape
  for absState: one raft node = ONE `.struct raft.raft` cell (~33
  named fields); scalars (Term/Vote/lead/state uint64) direct;
  raftLog behind a pointer (committed/applied/applying scalars on
  that cell; entries deeper behind unstable/storage + interface).
- 2026-08-22 [AGENT] Contact verdict on the seam design's cost
  assumption: "few-line bodies" is FALSE at machine level for
  becomeFollower — the 8-statement body drags reset → {Intn's
  10-iteration map build + mutex, tracker.Visit's choice-driven
  range + sort-slice + 3 closure calls each doing
  raftLog.lastIndex → interface dispatch → MemoryStorage + mutex},
  plus logger interface dispatch. Pilot plan adjusted WITHIN the
  charter: absState v1 + the equation built bottom-up as per-callee
  run equations (the composition shape (B) prescribes anyway),
  starting from the leaf `abortLeaderTransfer` to validate the
  equation FORM end-to-end and measure per-ingredient proof cost;
  full becomeFollower composition attempted only if measured leaf
  costs make it feasible in-unit; otherwise the pilot ends at the
  honest gap + NO-GO verdict with the measured numbers (exactly the
  seam design's "anything else → re-design here" branch).
- 2026-08-22 Slice 1 (85acbb0c): `proofs/GoLeanProofs/Specs/Raft/AbsState.lean`
  (absRaftNode v1 Option reader, gaps GAP-V1-1..5 numbered in the
  docstring; specBecomeFollower re-grounded) +
  `proofs/GoLeanProofs/Specs/Raft/HandlerEq.lean` (`storeTarget_field` —
  the struct-field store form the kit lacks, closed locally;
  `alt_call_span` — the 15-step span equation for the leaf callee
  `abortLeaderTransfer`, abstract σ, symbolic addresses/fields, ten
  windows chained with `stepFnIter_chain`). [AGENT] Spec-side call:
  `specBecomeFollower` is a RE-GROUNDED mirror citing
  VerdiCompat/Raft.lean + Raft.v + the subject — NOT an import of
  compat/verdi (constitution §5 Plan A: compat/verdi is a read-only
  reference, never an import; the two-line correspondence to
  `advanceCurrentTerm` + Follower/lead override is stated in the
  docstring with its `st.term ≤ t` side condition).
- 2026-08-22 Slice 2: `BecomeFollowerWitness.lean` — the §3.3
  discharge witness: every `alt_call_span` premise proved on a
  concrete state over the PINNED tables (twinLowered's
  funcs/methods/types; raft cell = the machine's own defaultValue at
  raft.raft with raftLog pointed at a default raftLog cell), plus
  `alt_witness_projection` (absRaftNode preserved across the call
  and = some ⟨0,0,0,0,0,0⟩ — live, not vacuous). All rfl discharges
  #eval-checked first (WitnessProbe). [AGENT] GAP-U1-W1: the witness
  state is well-formed-by-construction, NOT proved reachable — a
  reachable-state witness needs Arc-2's checkpoint reflection (raw
  kernel evaluation to the first call site @ ~22k steps is measured
  infeasible, Arc-2 route study); recorded, not claimed. Modules
  wired into the GoLeanProofs aggregator; full proofs+Audit build
  green (469 jobs). `#print axioms`: storeTarget_field /
  alt_call_span / alt_call_span_witness all
  [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]; alt_witness_projection
  [propext].

- 2026-08-22 Slice 3: **the gate caught a layering violation** —
  `scripts/ci`'s import-direction lint: general-layer proof modules
  (outside `Specs/`) may not import `GoLeanProofs.Specs.*`, and the
  witness (then at `proofs/GoLeanProofs/Raft/`) imports the
  `Specs.TwinProgram` pin. The modules are TARGET-layer
  infrastructure anyway (they name `raft.raft`), so the fix is the
  lint's own first remedy: all three moved to
  `proofs/GoLeanProofs/Specs/Raft/` (aggregator + doc paths updated;
  slice-1/2 entries above rewritten to the final paths — the
  original path `GoLeanProofs/Raft/` existed only at 85acbb0c..).
  This ALSO corrects the seam design's "never imported by statement
  modules" layering to the repo's mechanized form: the general/target
  split is the enforced boundary; statement modules simply do not
  import the seam modules (checked by reading; no lint needed).
- 2026-08-22 Writer note: commit 2c396efe (coordinator's
  campaign-level log entry, `docs/raft-campaign-log.md` only — Arc 3
  unit 4 record) landed on this branch between my slices 1 and 2.
  File-disjoint from this unit's tree; recorded per the one-writer
  discipline, no action needed.

### PROMOTION LEDGER (kit gaps with ≥2 plausible future consumers)

- `storeTarget_field` (HandlerEq.lean) — struct-field store through a
  pointer anchor; every handler field write hits it. Lift to StepKit
  on the second consumer (kit rule: 2 landed consumers, retrofit in
  the lifting commit).
- Normality preservation under `StructFields.set` (isNormalForTy of a
  struct survives setting a field to a normal value) — needed to turn
  per-store `hnorm` hypotheses into derived facts in ∀-state
  equations; `isNormalForTyFuel_sound` is the existing half.
- Closure CALL-VALUE frame entry (`callValArgsK` analogue of
  `stepFn_call_enter`) — tracker.Visit's per-node closure calls;
  any Go program calling a func value needs it. (OQ-B's one gap.)
- `sync-op` step forms (sequential Lock/Unlock crossing) — every
  mutex-guarded subject path (lockedRand, MemoryStorage).
- `sort-slice` stmtOp form (applyStmtOp sortSlice fact) —
  tracker.Visit and quorum CommittedIndex both sort.
